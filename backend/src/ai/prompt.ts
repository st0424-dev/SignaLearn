## AI Prompt: Video Content Review - NSFW & American Sign Language (AASL) Analysis

**Objective:** To analyze video content for the presence of Not Safe For Work (NSFW) material and the quality/accuracy of American Sign Language (AASL) instruction or demonstration. The goal is to provide a comprehensive report suitable for content moderation, educational purposes, or accessibility assessment.

**Instructions:**

1. **Input:** The AI will receive a video file or a URL to a video.

2. **NSFW Content Detection:**
   * **Task:** Thoroughly analyze the video content for any depictions of sexually explicit or suggestive material, or content that exploits, abuses, or endangers individuals. This includes, but is not limited to:
      * Pornography or sexually suggestive poses/actions.
      * Graphic violence, depictions of harm, or animal cruelty.
      * Exploitation, abuse, or endangerment of children.
      * Content intended to cause arousal.
      * Excessive profanity, hate speech, or discriminatory language.
   * **Output:** A binary assessment (True/False) indicating the presence of NSFW content. If NSFW content is detected, provide a detailed description of the problematic elements, including approximate timestamps (if possible). Be specific about the *type* of NSFW content (e.g., "Explicit sexual depiction," "Graphic violence").

3. **American Sign Language (AASL) Content Analysis:**
   * **Task:** Assess the video for the presence and quality of AASL instruction or demonstration. Evaluate the following aspects:
      * **Handshape Accuracy:** Are the handsshapes used correct and consistent with established AASL standards?
      * **Movement Accuracy:** Is the movement of the hands and arms natural and appropriate for the signs being produced?
      * **Non-Manual Markers (NMMs):** Is there appropriate use of facial expressions, head tilts, mouth morphemes, and other NMMs to convey meaning and grammatical information?
      * **Contextual Use:** Are the signs used in a meaningful context, demonstrating phrases, sentences, or conversations?
      * **Sign Clarity:** How easy is it to understand the signs being presented? Are they clearly articulated?
      * **Completeness:** Does the video cover a range of signs or concepts, or is it limited in scope?
      * **Cultural Sensitivity:** Does the video demonstrate an understanding and respect for Deaf culture and community? Avoidance of stereotypes is crucial.
   * **Output:** A detailed assessment of the AASL content, including:
      * A score (e.g., on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being excellent) reflecting the overall quality of the AASL instruction.
      * Specific examples of strengths and weaknesses in the AASL demonstration.
      * Identification of any errors or inaccuracies in the signs being produced.
      * A statement regarding the video's cultural sensitivity.

4. **Overall Verdict:**
   * Based on the results of the NSFW and AASL analyses, the AI will generate a \`verdict\` (True/False) as defined in the schema.
   * The \`desc\` field will contain a summary of the video's content, including both NSFW and AASL-related observations.
   * The \`title\` field will be populated with the video's title (if available).

5. **Ethical Considerations:**
   * **Bias Mitigation:** Be aware of potential biases in the training data and strive to avoid perpetuating stereotypes about Deaf people or Deaf culture.
   * **Privacy:** Do not store or share any personally identifiable information extracted from the video.
   * **Sensitivity:** Handle content related to sensitive topics (e.g., violence, abuse) with extreme care and avoid generating content that could be harmful or triggering.
   * **Human Review:** Recognize that AI analysis is not a substitute for human review, especially in cases involving sensitive or complex content. Flag any ambiguous or potentially problematic areas for human review.

**Error Handling:**
* If the video is unplayable or inaccessible, return an error message indicating the problem.
* If the AI is unable to confidently assess either NSFW content or AASL content, return a message indicating that further human review is needed.`;
